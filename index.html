                    <h2>Object Study</h2>
                        <p>For this task we had to take a mundane object we had in our bag and draw around it to create something interesting. This was a little challenging for me since my object was essentially just a line by itself, but I enjoyed drawing what I came up with in the end. It helped me think more creatively about prop design and how you don't have to be confined to the typical array of objects associated with a topic if there's no reason not to think outside the box. I think that this piece shows that I can quickly come up with an idea and delve into it deeper with smaller details in a short amount of time. In the future, I am going to take a more creative approach to prop design, and keep in mind the “describing it as an alien” aspect as it can place you in a mindset with a completely different perspective than you're used to.</p>

                <p>In this task we went outside to find a person we found interesting, drew them and created attributes for them. I chose a middle aged man with a really interesting fluffy jacket with bright green and purple stripes. I am drawn to big shapes, interesting silhouettes and contrasting colours when it comes to character design. I included this piece because I believe it shows that I am able to transfer 2d shapes to 3d shapes in a coherent way, and it has been something that has always been a bit challenging for me and I think it turned out well in this instance.</p>

                <p>For this story board I created a simple story using everyone's character who was in my group. It was a bit hard at first to think of something that made sense, but after I got the ball rolling it was easier to connect the individual ideas from everyone just by pulling from prior knowledge about tropes and movies. Since there are so many stories about horses, animals, or a person seeking out their dream place to live, there was a lot to pull from when at first it seemed like all the ideas were disconnected. After that, Isabelle, one of my group members removed the background from the pictures we took of the plasticine and I edited them into the board to tell the story. I think this work showcases the diverse ways you can create a storyboard, and I personally learned that having a set amount of assets and manipulating them into different shot sizes and compositions can be just as effective as drawing.</p>

                <img src="images/Story_Of_Orpheus_Board.png" alt="A black and white storyboard of a man putting on gloves and going through a mirror" class="center">
                <p>For this task we were suppose to make a storyboard out of our favorite frames in the movie "." I had a lot of fun with this 
                project, it was challenging because of how much emphasis was on the hands but not so much in that it was frusterating. Since
                the film was in black and white it made it easier to add values and I really enjoyed doing that with the cross hatching instead
                of just selecting a color and filling in things solid, since the sketches were rough a lot of the linework wasnt connected so using 
                the fill tool would have been slower than cross hatching and I liked how it turned out even if I didnt get to add values to everything.</p>

                <p>for this task we were suppose to pick an object we had and draw it, then re-draw the drawing our neighbor drew of their object in order to animate them
                transitioning from one to another. Since we had no lightbox my animation sorta stays in the same plays or moves at odd times, but I really enjoyed
                the process of animating, at first it was hard to decide what order to draw the keyframes but I got the hang of it. I really liked thinking
                about what the combination of two frames would be, it was challenging enough to be fun but not enough to be frusterating.</p>

            <img src="images/response project 2.jpg" alt="A paper model of two people on two train cars" height="600" width="1000" class="center">
            <p>
                For this project we were supposed to make a response to an image of a man hugging a boy from a train car window, and a song with religious themes. I included this piece because it shows how I can use different mediums and experiment with unique supplies in order to achieve a coherent narrative. I think this shows how quickly I can adapt to using new supplies as an artist, and come up with new ways to incorporate them with things I already know about. For example, I had never used oil pastels before, but I used cross hatching which I was familiar with, which I believe made an appealing colourful design. While making this, I learned that I really love making 3d paper artwork, as well as using oil pastels. I am definitely going to find more ways to use both these mediums in my work in the future.

            <h2>Model Box</h2>

            <img src="images/modbox 3.jpg" alt="A cardboard model of a cottage" height="600" width="600" class="center">
            <p>For this task we were supposed to create a model of a place or scene using any crafting or recycled materials we had. I included this piece in my portfolio because it showcases the way I think about design and storytelling when it comes to a physical 3d space. Initially I had planned to create a floral scene, then after realizing I didn't like how the furniture I made turned out, I decided to go for more of an entrance to a cottage. While I was working on the brick pattern, I was looking at the materials my friend had brought and decided that adding a key on the ground in front of the door might make the piece more mysterious and tell more of a story. I think the most challenging thing about this project was deciding which medium worked best for adding colour to the base cardboard. I used coloured pencils and markers since I didn't have to wait for them to dry, but they weren't the easiest to blend so I had to rely on the colours that I brought without being able to make new ones. In the end, this made it so the palette of the model box was harmonious and the places where I added bits of new colours stood out more as a nice contrast that leads your eye around the piece. The thing I enjoyed the most was figuring out how to combine different materials into something that felt cohesive and not chaotic. I learned that making something with materials already at your disposal can limit you in a good way that ties your work together, like using a lot of cardboard or plastic.</p>

            <h2>Maidstone Shortiflm</h2>
            <video src="videos/maidstone project.mp4" controls poster="images/maidstone poster.jpg" height="600" width="1000" class="center">
                <p>	For this project we were given a script to shoot with the cameras and lights provided by Maidstone Studios without being able to edit any of the clips. I included this piece because the main restraint is different from the most common main restraint in most of my work, being time. The main restraint with this piece was not being able to edit the clips together. This meant that since time wasn't really as big of an issue we were able to put more of our creative efforts into timing, composition and the lighting, especially since we were already given a script as well. I believe that the kind of lighting I helped create shows how I value bold colours in my work, in editing, drawing and physical lighting. I learned that being able to problem solve around a big change that you’re not used to like not being able to edit, can help you to think quicker and come up with more ideas to accommodate that fact. In our case, we couldn't have a lot of wide shots because we wouldn't be able to crop out the lights or other people around, this meant most of our shots had to be very close up, but it gave the film a more intimate feeling which fit the narrative of the scene. In the future, I will think about how to work around certain aspects I find crucial to a production that I might not have, but also find ways to embrace it as well.</p>

            <h2>Mockumentary</h2>
            <video src="videos/mockumentary.mp4" controls poster="images/mockumentary poster.png" class="center"></video>
                <p>I included this piece to showcase my early editing skills and show how I’ve improved from here. I believe as an artist, this shows how much I value pacing in my work, as even though it is one of the first videos I edited I think the pacing fits the narrative of the piece very well. When doing this piece I learned how important it is to plan your time around a task you know you're not familiar with doing, since I had not edited very many things at that point I didn't know exactly how long it would take. I know now that if I’m doing something I’m not familiar with, I should add extra time to that task.</p>
